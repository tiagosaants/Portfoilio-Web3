# 🏢💰 MetaMask Integration for Real Estate Investment Platform

This project involved implementing the **MetaMask** digital wallet as a payment method on an innovative real estate investment platform.

### Background

### What Was Done  
- Full integration of the MetaMask wallet into the web platform  
- Implementation of cryptocurrency payment flow (Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens)  
- Ensured transaction security through digital signatures  
- User-friendly interface enabling easy wallet connection and payments  
- Real-time validation of transaction status on the blockchain  

### Benefits  
- Simplified international payments without banking intermediaries  
- Secure, immutable, and transparent transactions  
- Access to a global audience of real estate investors and buyers  
- Platform modernization aligned with Web3 trends
